# Library for AVR PWM on arbitrary pins

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_PWM.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_PWM)

This library is designed to provide 'software' PWM output for any digital pin.

## Important Notes:
- This library uses AVR TIMER1 or TIMER2 to implement the interrupt driven clock, selectable in the library header file.
- This library has been tested on Arduino Uno and Nano only (ie, 328P processor).
